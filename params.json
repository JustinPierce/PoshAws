{"name":"PoshAws","tagline":"PowerShell commands to manage Amazon Web Services resources","body":"### Installation\r\n\r\nGet the source:\r\n\r\n* `git clone https://github.com/healthbox/PoshAws.git`, or â€¦\r\n* download one of the archives provided.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell, navigate to the directory where PoshAws is located and execute `.\\install.ps1`.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nPoshAws needs the AWS SDK assembly to work. You can get it from [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/) or [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK/).\r\n\r\nAfter you have the SDK assembly, you'll need to import it in each PowerShell session before using PoshAws.\r\n\r\n* `Import-AwsSdk`, when the assembly is in your current directory (or a sub-directory).\r\n* `Import-AwsSdk -SearchPath ..\\some-otherdirectory`, when it's not.\r\n\r\n### Credentials\r\n\r\nPoshAws needs your AWS credentials to work. You can create them with `New-AwsCredentials`. The returned credentials can be passed to any PoshAws command with the `Credentials` parameter.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nNew-AwsCredentials -AccessKeyId YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID -SecretAccessKey YOUR_SECRET_SHHHH\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this every time can be a real pain. PoshAws can store your credentials for you. Your credentials are stored **in plain text** in your PowerShell profile directory; so, be sure you understand how to protect your Windows profile.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nNew-AwsCredentials -AccessKeyId YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID -SecretAccessKey YOUR_SECRET_SHHHH `\r\n  | Add-StoredAwsCredentials -Name WhateverNameYouWouldLike\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, even simpler.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nAdd-StoredAwsCredentials -Name WhateverNameYouWouldLike -AccessKeyId YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID -SecretAccessKey YOUR_SECRET_SHHHH\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can get your credentials back with `Get-StoredAwsCredentials -Name WhateverNameYouUsed` and list your stored credentials with `Get-StoredAwsCredentialNames`.\r\n\r\nProviding credentials to every command is tedious. To avoid this, you can use `Push-AwsCredentials` and `Pop-AwsCredentials`. For example:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-StoredAwsCredentials -Name EasyPeasy | Push-AwsCredentials\r\n# A slew of commands\r\nPop-AwsCredentials\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne last thing. If your commands are running on an EC2 instance with an [IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingIAM.html#UsingIAMrolesWithAmazonEC2Instances), PoshAws will use the role's credentials without you having to do a thing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
